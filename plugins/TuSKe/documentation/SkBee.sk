	Particle Spawn:
		ID: EffParticle
		Description:
			Spawn a particle. This system is more inline with how Bukkit deals with particles, hence the amount of patterns.
			Some particles may be affected differently by these values, so let's break them down:
			
first number = count, how many particles to spawn at once.
			
particle = the particle to spawn.
			
using = the data used for this particle (some particles like 'block', 'item' and 'dust' require more data).
			
location = where you are going to spawn the particle.
			
offset = a vector with the maximum random offset. The position of each particle will be randomized positively and negatively by the offset parameters on each axis.
			I believe some particles use the offset to set color. I'm not positive on this.
			
extra = the extra data for this particle, depends on the particle used (normally speed).
			
Requires Minecraft 1.13+
		Examples:
			play 3 of item particle using diamond at location of player
			play 1 of block particle using dirt at location of target block
			play 10 of poof at player offset by vector(2, 2, 2) with extra 0.5
			play 20 of dust using dustOption(blue, 10) at location above target block
			play 1 of dust_color_transition using dustTransition(blue, green, 3) at location of player
			play 1 of vibration using vibration({loc1}, {loc2}, 1 second) at {loc1}

		Since:

			If you are unsure of all tag options, just return a list of all tags to see what is available.

	NBT - Compound of:
		ID: ExprNbtCompound
		Description:
			Get the nbt compound of a block/entity/item/file. This is a more advanced version of NBT than just getting an NBT string 
			which allows for better manipulation. Optionally you can return a copy of the compound. This way you can modify it without 
			actually modifying the original compound, for example when grabbing the compound from an entity, modifying it and applying to 
			other entities. NBT from files and items will not be the original, but will be a copy.
		Examples:
			set {_n} to nbt compound of player's tool
			set {_nbt} to nbt compound of target entity
			set {_n} to nbt compound of "{id:""minecraft:diamond_sword"",tag:{Damage:0,Enchantments:[{id:""minecraft:sharpness"",lvl:3s}]},Count:1b}"

	NBT - Item from NBT:
		ID: ExprItemFromNBT
		Description:
			This expression allows you to grab an item from NBT strings or compounds (compound support added in 1.6.0). 
			This can be useful when wanting to grab items from file nbt, or nbt of an entity or an inventory holding block (like a chest or furnace).
			It can also be useful for creating your own serializing system. The NBT string required for this must be an item's FULL item NBT 
			(This must include the item type and amount, example of full: "{id:"minecraft:iron_sword",tag:{Damage:0},Count:1b}"
			 example of partial nbt of the same item: "{Damage:0}").
		Examples:
			set {_i} to item from nbt "{id:""minecraft:iron_sword"",tag:{Damage:0},Count:1b}"
			

			set {_nbt::*} to tag "Inventory" of file nbt of "world/playerdata/some-players-uuid.dat"

		Changers:

	NBT - Item/Inventory Slot/Entity/Block/File:
		ID: ExprObjectNBT
		Description:
			NBT of items, inventory slots, entities, tile entities (such as a furnace, hopper, brewing stand, banner, etc) or files. 
			Supports get, set, add and reset. Reset will only properly work on an item, not entities or blocks. 
			Set should not be used on entities or blocks, it's best to use add. Using set can quite often screw up the entity/block's location. 
			The optional 'full' part (added in 1.4.10) will only work on items/slots. When using this, it will return the full NBT of said item, 
			including the item amount as well as the item type.
		Examples:
			set {_nbt} to nbt of player's tool
			set {_f} to full nbt of player's tool
			add "{Enchantments:[{id:""sharpness"",lvl:5}]}" to nbt of player's tool
			reset nbt of player's tool
			set {_nbt} to nbt of target entity
			set {_nbt} to event-entity
			add "{CustomName:""{\""text\"":\""&bMyNewName\""}""}" to nbt of target entity
			add "{RequiredPlayerRange:0s}" to targeted block's nbt
			add "{SpawnData:{id:""minecraft:wither""}}" to nbt of clicked block
			set {_nbt} to file-nbt of "world/playerdata/some-uuid-here.dat"

	NBT - Pretty NBT String:
		ID: ExprPrettyNBT
		Description:
			Get a 'pretty' NBT string. This is colored the same as when using the vanilla Minecraft '/data' command. 
			Splitting it will output kind of like a JSON output. Requires 1.13.2+
		Examples:
			set {_p} to pretty nbt from nbt compound of player's tool
			send pretty nbt from {_nbt} to player
			send pretty nbt from {_nbt} with split " " to console
		Since:
			1.6.0

		Patterns:

			%nbtcompounds/strings%'[s] pretty nbt [(with|using) split %-string%]
	NBT - Tag:
		ID: ExprTagOfNBT
		Description:
			Returns the value of the specified tag of the specified NBT. Also supports getting nested tags using a semi colon as a delimiter.
			If the return value is a list, you can use it as a list, as it will automatically split it for ya.
			As of 1.6.0 you can also set/delete tags, but only with NBT compounds, not NBT strings. Do note that setting the tag of an item
			will not update it, you will have to create a variable for the NBT compound of the item, set the tag of that variable, then set the item back
			using the 'nbt item of' expression. I understand this is a bit convoluted but unfortunately that is just how it works. See examples.
			Also note that you can NOT create custom tags for entities/blocks. As of 1.7.1 blocks(tile entities)/entities will be able to hold custom nbt
			data in the "custom" tag of said block/entity. Due to Minecraft not supporting this, I had to use some hacky methods to make this happen.
			That said, this system is a tad convoluted, see the SkBee WIKI for more details.
			As of 1.10.0 you can now add custom NBT to any block (the same as you would for tile entities)(This is only support on 1.16.4+). 
			Since Minecraft does not natively support this, the NBT is actually stored in the chunk's NBT. See wiki for more info.
			As of 1.10.0 you can get/set specific tag types of NBT compounds, allowing for more detailed control of what type your tag is going to be.

	NBT - UUID for NBT:
		ID: ExprNBTUuid
		Description:
			Allows you to get an entity's UUID which can be represented in an NBT compound. Prior to 1.16 UUIDs were represented 
			as most/least significant bits. As of 1.16, they are now represented as int arrays. If the player/entity is excluded, this 
			will return a random UUID.
		Examples:
			set {_u::*} to uuid int array of player
			set {_u} to uuid int array as string from player
			set {_m} to uuid most from target entity
			set {_l} to uuid least bits of event-entity
		Since:

	Text Component - Base Component:
		ID: BaseComponent
		Description:
			Text components used for hover/click events. Due to the complexity of these, 
			they can NOT be long term stored in variables.
		Examples:
			set {_t} to text component from "CLICK FOR OUR DISCORD"
			set hover event of {_t} to a new hover event showing "Clicky Clicky!"
			set click event of {_t} to a new click event to open url "https://OurDiscord.com"
			send component {_t} to player
		Since:

		Examples:
			set world type of {_creator} to flat
		Usage: normal, flat, large biomes, amplified
		Since:
			1.8.0
		Patterns:
			world[ ]type[s]
Functions:
	dustOption:
		Description:
			Creates a new dust option to be used with 'dust' particle. Color can either be a regular color or an RGB color using
			Skript's rgb() function. Size is the size the particle will be.
		Examples:
			set {_c} to dustOption(red, 1.5)
			set {_c} to dustOption(rgb(1, 255, 1), 3)
		Since:
			1.9.0
		Return type: dustoption
		Patterns:
			dustOption(color: color, size: number)
	dustTransition:
		Description:
			Creates a new dust transition to be used with 'dust_color_transition' particle.
			Color can either be a regular color or an RGB color using Skript's rgb() function.
			Size is the size the particle will be. Requires MC 1.17+
		Examples:
			set {_d} to dustTransition(red, green, 10)
			set {_d} to dustTransition(blue, rgb(1,1,1), 5)
		Since:
			1.11.1
		Return type: dusttransition
		Patterns:
			dustTransition(fromcolor: color, tocolor: color, size: number)
	vibration:
		Description:
			Creates a new vibration to be used with 'vibration' particle.
			FROM = the origin location the particle will start at.
			TO = the destination location the particle will travel to.
			ARRIVAL TIME = the time it will take to arrive at the destination location. Requires MC 1.17+
		Examples:
			set {_v} to vibration({loc1}, {loc2}, 10 seconds)
		Since:
			1.11.1
		Return type: vibration
		Patterns:
			vibration(from: location, to: location, arrivaltime: timespan)
